Loading datasets
```{r}

Exploring the data, some visualizations.
```{r}
energy_types %>%
  view()

energy_types %>%
  str()

energy_types %>%
  distinct(country_name)

energy_types %>%
  count(type, sort = TRUE)

types_pivoted <- energy_types %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("2016", "2017", "2018"), #cols = starts_with("2") works too!
               names_to = "year", #creats title for "years" column
               values_to = "gigawatt_hours") %>%  #creates title for "values" column
  view()

types_pivoted %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ country_name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "How are European countries generating energy?",
       x = "",
       y = "", 
       fill = "Type") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman")) 

```

That was a bit of a fail.. David's take.
Some ideas:  
-A map (no animation since we only have three years worth of data) 
-Graph of energy consumption by type over time
-Exports, imports, etc.
```{r}
energy_types %>% 
  count(level, sort = TRUE)

energy_types %>%
  count(level, type, sort = TRUE) #All level 2's from Pumped Hydro power.

energy_types %>%
  count(country_name, sort = TRUE)

```

```{r}
energy_types %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("2"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "gigawatt_hours")
```

```{r}
country_totals %>%
  view()
```
